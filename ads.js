 * This is a pro adblock message, to show users that ads are displaying and they should use an adblock.
 * If they already are, the name of the file (ads.js) and/or the class of the message (bottomAd) will be blocked by the adblock and so those users won't see anything!
 * 
 * You can use it in your own page if you want, just append:
 *     <script src="https://trianguloy.github.io/ads.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
 * anywhere, and the message will be shown in that location if the user is not using any adblock.
